Mostly i use to write the test cases for each layer .
 
 same time my time get over, so shared without writing it, but i used @mock annotation and when and return for writing the testcase.

Controller:

1. testdatapass (testcasename)- -> having the file in correct location and making it pass.
2. testdatapass2-   -> without having the file in the location showing the message. but not throws any exception.
3. testdataexception ->  Failure for the testdata.

Service:

gettransaction -> high level, we can have 2 test cases one is positive for try and other one for catch.
checknormaltrasaction -> just have 1 tc or 3 tc 
appliedChargesToMarketValue -> 3 tescases -> 1. try ,2.catch ,3 .catch 
transactionDTO -> 1 TC 
checkIntraDayTransaction -> 1 or 2 TC.
